# Varabel Admin

Varabel Admin is a React-based admin dashboard application. This project was built for a company I previously worked for, and while some elements have been modified and the name changed, the UI remains similar to the original. Please note that the data used in this project is prewritten and not real; it is included to provide a relatable experience.

## Features

- User authentication (login and signup)
- Dashboard with transaction summaries
- Product management (view, add, edit, delete)
- Account settings management
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Router
- Axios
- Tailwind CSS
